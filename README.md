# Menace

Self-learning tic-tac-toe bot.

Menace stands for **M**achine **E**ducable **K**nots **A**nd **C**rosses **E**ngine.

The idea and name for this project was adopted from [Matt Parker's](http://standupmaths.com/) [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9c-_neaxeU) of a pile of matchboxes that could learn to play tic-tac-toe, published on his [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCSju5G2aFaWMqn-_0YBtq5A), standupmaths. 

However, the idea to make a self learning tic-tac-toe engine [has been around for years](https://www.dropbox.com/s/ycsycu0l01g9643/DonaldMichie.pdf?dl=0).

Our goals for this iteration of self-learning tic-tac-toe are the following:
1. To provide a simple, documented sample of what the simplest form of machine learning can look like
2. To implement this idea across different platforms and programming languages.
